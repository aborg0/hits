This package is using the following components:
  * [KNIME](http://www.knime.org/downloads/knime) 2.1.0 or above (The first [screencast](http://www.knime.org/introduction/screencasts) helps you to install it.)
    * You will need to install the **KNIME math expression extension (JEP)** too.
  * ~~[KNIME Labs](http://labs.knime.org/)'s~~ **KNIME Distance Matrix Feature** 2.1.0 or above
  * [KNIME Labs](http://labs.knime.org/)'s **KNIME image processing feature** 2.1.1 or above - _optional_
  * [R](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) 2.8.x, 2.9.x, 2.10.x, 2.11.x or 2.12.x ([help to install and setup R](InstallR.md))
  * [CellHTS2](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cellHTS2.html) 2.6.x, 2.8.x, 2.10.x, 2.12.x or 2.14.x (recommends `locfit`) ([help to install and setup CellHTS2](InstallCellHTS2.md))
  * [Rserve](http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/) 0.6.0 or later ([help to install and setup Rserve](InstallRserve.md)) (Might work with 0.5.2 too.)
  * [Java SE 6](http://java.sun.com/javase/) (SUN JRE 6 update 10 and above have very annoying UI problems with KNIME under MS Windows, Linux, so those are not recommended; the one is included with the KNIME installation is mostly OK, so you do not have to download anything. Although the Sun JRE 6 update 14 and above looks really good, so you might consider using it.)
