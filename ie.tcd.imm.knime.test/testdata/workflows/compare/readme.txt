This workflow shows a way to compare different data analysis methods.
For usage you have to change the file references according to your selection.
The sample data can be found: ../../plate8 folder
(http://code.google.com/p/hits/source/browse/#svn/ie.tcd.imm.knime.test/trunk/testdata/plate8 ,
or http://hits.googlecode.com/svn/ie.tcd.imm.knime.test/trunk/testdata/plate8).

That data is generated using NoiseMaker (www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/rocky08/presentations/52-kwan.pdf).
The actual hits (the intended outliers) can be found in the hits.txt file.
