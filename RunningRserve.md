This page describes how to run Rserve on your computer.

First you have to install Rserve. You can follow [this guide](InstallCellHTS2.md).

You may start it with the shortcut, or with the `library("Rserve")` command. (Please take attention to the proxy settings if you want to use the [biomaRt Annotator](biomaRtAnnotatorNode.md) node in both case.)
