It is useful to have a target platform set before you start the development. That should contain a normal KNIME setup with distmatrix, jep installed.

Your IDE should have TestNG, Groovy, Maven, Buckminster plugins installed.

You need to set the {{{JAVA_HOME}}} variable in your Windows machine pointing to a JDK root folder (which has {{{xjc.exe}}} tool in its {{{bin}}} folder.).
