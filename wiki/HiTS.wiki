= Introduction =

The aim of this project to help the *Hi* gh *T* hroughput *S* creening process. The current subgoal is developing nodes to [http://knime.org/ KNIME] helping the data analysis of the results.

= Details =

At current stage the plugin is able to import data (the summary by wells data) from IN Cell Analyser 1000 Excel output, analyse it using [http://www.dkfz.de/signaling/cellHTS/ CellHTS2], and use [http://knime.org/ KNIME plugins] to further analyse the results of the output of the [CellHTS2Node CellHTS2 node]. Also created some nodes to visualise the data in a plate-based form heatmaps, denrogram with heatmap, or just a heatmap.

Currently only cellHTS2 2.6.x is supported (the new 2.8.x series is not yet).

= First steps after [Install install] =
An easy approach to start is downloading the content of [http://hits.googlecode.com/svn/ie.tcd.imm.knime.test/trunk/testdata/plate8/ this folder], and import [http://hits.googlecode.com/svn/ie.tcd.imm.knime.test/trunk/testdata/workflows/sampleCellHTS2/sample1.zip this workflow]. After that you [http://hits.googlecode.com/svn/ie.tcd.imm.knime.test/trunk/testdata/workflows/sampleCellHTS2/readme.txt should follow the instructions] to get familiar with this data analysis tool.
