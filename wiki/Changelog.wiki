#summary Changes in the project

= HiTS =
== Changes from 0.1.1 to 0.2.0 ==
Date: 5th May 2009 (available since 30th April 2009)

Added 3 new nodes:
 * Simple Heatmap (Data Views/)
 * Dendrogram with Heatmap (HiTS/) (based on the original Hierarchical Clustering node, thanks for the KNIME GMbH, but compatible only with the New Hierarchical Clustering node from KNIME labs)
 * Sort by Cluster (Distance Matrix/)

Renames:
 * Heatmap -> Plate Heatmap
 * Importer -> INCell xls Importer

Improved the Colour selection forms (except the one in the selection of default).

Documentation reviewed, improved. Many thanks to Dr. Dara Dunican.

Updated the update site, so from this point it will handle installs from eclipse 3.4 or above. See issue #13.

Added an [http://hits.googlecode.com/svn/ie.tcd.imm.knime.test/trunk/testdata/plate8/ example workflow] and [http://hits.googlecode.com/svn/ie.tcd.imm.knime.test/trunk/testdata/workflows/sampleCellHTS2/ sample data]. See issue #15. Thanks for Amanda Birmingham to allow to use her NoiseMaker program to generate the data set.

More robust handling of input data with CellHTS2 node (support for missing values, NaNs, works correctly with 1 replicate, and more than 9 (but less than 1000) parameters).

The Plate Heatmap (also Simple Heatmap, Dendrogram with Heatmap) now accepts missing values too.

The nodes with views handle better their resets.

Added a Help button to the configuration of the CellHTS2 node. It opens the help page describing the options.

As a problem fixed in KNIME 2.0.2 a filter added to the parameter columns in CellHTS2 node. By default it excludes the Plate, Replicate, Position columns.

The Ranking node's configuration panel is fixed, not it shows the proper values for the first open too.

== Changes from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1 ==
Date: 4th March 2009

Some bugfixes, little improvements, an incompatible update (using normalise instead of normalize in [RankNode Rank] node), added user documentation and some help to interpret the settings ([CellHTS2Node CellHTS2] and [HeatmapNode Heatmap] nodes).
